# Wine Quality Classifier

This project implements a machine learning model to classify wine quality using physicochemical features. The dataset includes red and white wine samples with quality ratings from 0 to 10.

## 🔍 Objective

To build a supervised learning classifier (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest) that predicts wine quality categories based on chemical properties.

## 📊 Dataset

- Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
- Features: pH, alcohol, sulphates, citric acid, etc.
- Label: Quality score (0–10)

## ⚙️ Technologies

- Python (Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- CSV data preprocessing

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
python wine_classifier.py
